# Hyppochoipus

This project is designed to celebrate the start of each academic year with a mini-sorting ceremony, inspired by the famous houses from the Harry Potter universe.

## Houses

| House           | Description        | Motto              |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Segfaultdor** | The house of the brave who are never afraid to crash their programs. These developers seek the thrill of segfaults and face core dumps head-on. They code boldly, without a safety net. | "If it crashes, we restart!" |
| **Algodaigle**  | The purists of optimization and complex algorithms. Students of Algodaigle do not tolerate inefficient loops or redundant code. They always seek the most optimized solution. | "O(log n) or nothing!" |
| **Stackouffle** | The heroes of developer forums, experts in finding solutions and copy-pasting. Their mastery of Stack Overflow is legendary, and they can solve any problem with just a couple of Google searches. | "Oh, it's not so bad!" |
| **Pythontard**  | The wizards of rapid and flexible development. They love high-level languages and avoid static types. Their code is fluid and fast, often in a single line.| "Why make it complicated when you can do it in one line?" |

## How It Works

At the start of the academic year, each new student will participate in a series of interactive questions to determine their house based on their skills and interests in development. The ceremony will highlight the unique qualities of each house and celebrate the diversity of talents.
